# Linux Notes — Desktop (Tauri + React + SQLite)

A native, fast desktop build of **Linux Notes**, an open-source Apple Notes
alternative for Linux. The UI is the same warm, paper-inspired design from the
prototype; the Rust backend stores notes in a local **SQLite** database.

> [!NOTE]
> This project is my playground for experimenting with OpenSpec and AI-Driven Development while building an application I've always wanted to have.

## Features

- Rich-text notes with autosave, tags (create/delete), favourites and search.
- **Images** inside notes — toolbar button, paste (Ctrl+V, incl. screenshots via
  the system clipboard), or drag & drop. Images are downscaled (max 1600 px) and
  embedded in the note, so everything stays in the DB.
- **Sketches** — a drawing canvas (pen colours/sizes, eraser, undo, clear) whose
  result is embedded as an image in the note, Apple-Notes style.
- **Tables** — insert/edit tables with in-table +/− handles to add/remove rows &
  columns, column alignment, and position-preserving cell copy/paste.
- **To-do checklists** — toolbar button; click the circle to tick items off.
  Enter continues the list, Enter on an empty item exits it. **Drag the ⠿ handle
  to reorder** items.
- **Find in note** — magnifier in the toolbar; highlights matches (CSS Custom
  Highlight API) with next/prev navigation.
- **Remembers** the last opened note and tag across launches.
- **Markdown shortcuts** while typing: `# `/`## `/`### ` headings, `- `/`* ` bullets,
  `1. ` numbered, `> ` quote, `[] ` to-do, and inline `**bold**`, `*italic*`, `` `code` ``.
- **Trash** with 30-day retention (restore / delete forever / empty), plus a
  Configuración panel for theme, mode and font size.
- **Backup** — export all notes + tags to a JSON file and import it on another
  machine (Configuración → Datos). Import merges by id, so it's non-destructive.
- **Themed app icon** — a notepad mark whose accent follows the active theme
  (the window icon is retinted at runtime; honoured by desktops that show window icons).

## Stack

- **Shell / backend:** [Tauri 2](https://tauri.app) (Rust) — small binary, native Linux packaging.
- **UI:** React 18 + Vite (the exact prototype design, pixel-for-pixel).
- **Storage:** SQLite via `rusqlite` (bundled — no system SQLite needed). The
  database lives in the platform app-data directory (e.g.
  `~/.local/share/org.linuxnotes.app/notes.db`). The app starts with **no notes**;
  a default set of **tags** (Trabajo · Personal · Proyectos · Ideas) is seeded so
  notes can be categorised right away. Tags can be created and deleted from the UI.

```

The frontend persists notes exclusively through the backend
(`list_notes`, `create_note`, `update_note`, `delete_note`, `toggle_favorite`).
Only theme preferences are kept in `localStorage`.

## Develop

Requires Rust, Node 18+, and the Tauri Linux system deps
(`libwebkit2gtk-4.1-dev`, `libgtk-3-dev`, `librsvg2-dev`).

```bash
cd desktop
npm install
npm run tauri dev      # launches the app with hot-reload
```

## Build a release bundle

```bash
cd desktop
npm run tauri build -- --bundles deb,rpm,appimage   # in src-tauri/target/release/bundle
```

- **`.deb`** — Debian/Ubuntu (`sudo dpkg -i`).
- **`.rpm`** — Fedora/openSUSE (`sudo dnf install ./*.rpm`). Tauri builds it with a
  pure-Rust packer, so no `rpmbuild` is required.
- **`.AppImage`** — distro-agnostic, just `chmod +x` and run.

Verify the `.deb` is well-formed before installing:

```bash
ar t "src-tauri/target/release/bundle/deb/Linux Notes_0.1.0_amd64.deb"
# should print: debian-binary / control.tar.gz / data.tar.gz
```

### Flatpak

The Flatpak installs the built `.deb` into the **GNOME 46 runtime** (which provides
`webkit2gtk-4.1`). Manifest + metainfo live in `flatpak/`.

> **glibc caveat:** the `.deb` binary must be built against a glibc **≤** the
> runtime's (GNOME 46 ≈ glibc 2.38). **Ubuntu 22.04 (glibc 2.35)** works — which is
> why CI builds there. If you build the `.deb` on a newer distro (e.g. Ubuntu 24.04,
> glibc 2.39) the Flatpak will build but fail at launch with
> `GLIBC_2.39 not found`. In that case build the `.deb` in a 22.04 container, or just
> let the **release workflow** produce the `.flatpak`.

To build locally (on Ubuntu 22.04, or adjust per the caveat above):

```bash
sudo apt install flatpak flatpak-builder      # or your distro's equivalent
flatpak install flathub org.gnome.Platform//46 org.gnome.Sdk//46

cd desktop
npm run tauri build -- --bundles deb
cp "src-tauri/target/release/bundle/deb/"*amd64.deb flatpak/linux-notes.deb

flatpak-builder --user --force-clean --repo flatpak-repo flatpak-build flatpak/org.linuxnotes.app.yml
flatpak build-bundle flatpak-repo linux-notes.flatpak org.linuxnotes.app \
  --runtime-repo=https://flathub.org/repo/flathub.flatpakrepo
# install & run:
flatpak install --user linux-notes.flatpak && flatpak run org.linuxnotes.app
```

## Automated releases (GitHub Actions)

`.github/workflows/release.yml` builds the `.deb`, `.rpm`, `.AppImage` and a
`.flatpak` in the cloud and publishes a **GitHub Release** whenever you push a
version tag (the Flatpak runs as a second job that reuses the `.deb`). The app version in
`package.json`, `Cargo.toml` and `tauri.conf.json` is synced from the tag
automatically, so all you do is:

```bash
git tag v0.2.0
git push origin v0.2.0
```

The workflow (also runnable from the Actions tab via "Run workflow") creates a
**draft** release with the installers attached — review it and hit *Publish*.
No secrets to configure: it uses the built-in `GITHUB_TOKEN`.

### Troubleshooting: "malformed archive" / corrupt `.deb`

This almost always means the build **failed** (often the linker was OOM-killed on
a low-memory machine such as WSL) and `ar`/`dpkg` is reading a stale `.deb` from a
previous attempt. Fixes:

```bash
rm -rf src-tauri/target/release/bundle   # remove stale artifacts
npm run tauri build                      # must end with "Finished 1 bundle at ..."
```

The `release` profile here deliberately avoids `lto`/`codegen-units = 1` so the
final link stays light on memory. If you still hit OOM, give WSL more RAM via
`~/.wslconfig` (`[wsl2]\nmemory=8GB`) or build the AppImage instead
(`npm run tauri build --bundles appimage`).
